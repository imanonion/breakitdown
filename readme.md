Why android?

- Phone is android (easy to use expo go app)
- no space on computer lol

Why Expo?

- easy to set up project
- many useful SDKs

Why TypeScript?

- Type checking functionality => catch errors before they occur in production
- Better documentation => easy to understand code written

Struggles:

- expo does not have perfect integration with Firebase (e.g. authentication)
- documentation on linking expo and firebase were not clear (e.g. need to create web app to get the firebaseConfig info)

Solved but struggled:
- SVG positioning (SVG taken from Figma which was easy, but did not know how to position the SVG...now I know I have to use viewbox)
- Countdown circle button took a long time to do as I had struggled to understand how the component works and how to add a button inside of the countdown-circle-timer
- Video format was wrong.. mov cannot be used in exoplayer. wasted a lot of time debugging

Yet to solve:
- ">" icon inside countdown circle button cannot change size
- how to run seed.ts file?
- video player
- onboard redirect bug
